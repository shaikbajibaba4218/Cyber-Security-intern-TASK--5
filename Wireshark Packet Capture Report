Wireshark Packet Capture Report

Objective: To capture network traffic using Wireshark, identify different protocols, and analyze the
captured packets.

Step 1 – Install Wireshark
Download and install the latest version of Wireshark from the official website.
Ensure installation includes WinPcap or Npcap (for Windows) to allow live packet capturing.


Step 2 – Start Capturing on Active Network Interface
Open Wireshark.
From the interface list, select your active connection (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
Click the blue Start Capture button.


Step 3 – Generate Network Traffic
While capturing, perform actions to create traffic, such as:
- Browsing a website.
- Running ping to a server (e.g., ping google.com).
- Checking email or loading an online video.


Step 4 – Stop the Capture
After about 1 minute of capturing, click the red Stop button in Wireshark.


Step 5 – Filter Captured Packets by Protocol
Use Wireshark’s display filter bar to isolate specific protocols, for example
- http → Show HTTP web traffic.
- dns → Show DNS queries and responses.
- tcp → Show TCP handshakes and communication.


Step 6 – Identify at Least 3 Different Protocols
Review the Protocol column in the packet list.
Common protocols found:
- DNS – Domain name lookups.
- TCP – Reliable transport protocol for most applications.
- HTTP/HTTPS – Web traffic.
- ICMP – Ping requests and replies.


Step 7 – Export the Capture
Go to File → Export Specified Packets.
Save the capture as a .pcap file for future analysis or sharing.


Step 8 – Summary of Findings
Multiple protocols were observed in the capture:
- DNS packets resolving domain names.
- TCP packets establishing and transferring data.
- HTTP packets transmitting website content.
The captured data demonstrates:
- How different protocols interact during typical network activity.
- The value of filtering to focus on relevant traffic.
